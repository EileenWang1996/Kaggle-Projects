# Kaggle-Projects

The repository contains my data analytics projects using data sets obtained from Kaggle. This is just some side stuff that I did which I thought would help develop my data science skills. 

Project 1: Predicting Avocado Prices was a small project that aims to predict avocado prices using recurrent neural networks. 

Project 2: UFO Data Exploratory Analysis analyses a dataset containing over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century. For fun, I also tried to determine which galaxies these aliens were coming from by calculating the right ascension and declination coordinates of the sightings and performing clustering on these coordinates.
