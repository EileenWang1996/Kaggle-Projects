# Kaggle-Projects

The repository contains my data analytics projects using data sets obtained from Kaggle. This is just some side stuff that I did which I thought would help develop my data science skills. 

**Project 1:** Predicting Avocado Prices was a small project that aims to predict avocado prices using recurrent neural networks. 

**Project 2:** UFO Data Exploratory Analysis.ipynb analyses a very interesting dataset containing over 80,000 reports of UFO sightings over the last century. 

**Project 3:** Prediction_Airbnb_Prices consists of a Kaggle competition project that involved predicting the overnight price of Airbnb listing. 

**Project 4:** Multi_Label_Prediction was a university deep learning assignment I did that involved solving a multi-label classification problem on image data with associated captions using transfer learning.
